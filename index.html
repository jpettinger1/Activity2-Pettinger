            I am currently a student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I'm 21 years of age and have lived in Omaha
            almost my entire life, although I was born in Iowa. I am currently working a part time job while attending
            university full time, I plan on attaining a internship this semester on top of the workload i currently have.
            I will graduate in December 2020 with a major in Computer science with a custom emphasis on database and web
            application development. While I may not have much experience to my name yet, I pride myself on my work ethic
            in real world settings, and i am willing to learn anything if it furthers my goal of obtaining a career in my
            field.
