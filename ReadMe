ISQA 3900 Activity 2 by Jacob Pettinger

/The index Page
The index page is the main page of the website it contains general information about myself along with a picture and serves
as an introductory page to the website. It contains several links, one of which connects it to itself and works as a refresh.
The second link leads to the about me page. At the bottom of the page there are a couple more links which lead to personal
contact information and an email address.

/The about page
The about page contains additional information about myself, this information is more personal and less business related.
It also contains an additional picture relating to myself. The about page contains the same hyperlinks as the index page
allowing for a user to jump between the index and about page as well as the contact information listed previously.

/main.css page
The css page contains the css for the entire website altering paragraphs images and headers so that the format is consistent
across each page and easily contained in one css file.
